        <p class="bodytext">To force the Standby Onboard Administrator to Active, click <b>Transition Standby to Active.</b> A confirmation screen appears, asking if you are sure that you want to perform the action. To proceed, click <b>OK. </b>To exit without a change, click <b>Cancel</b>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">This functionality is only available when you are signed into the Standby Onboard Administrator.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">You can also force the Standby Onboard Administrator to Active by using the FORCE TAKEOVER CLI command.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The transition times from Standby to Active and Active to Standby vary, depending on the configuration, enclosure population, and various other factors. Removing the previously Active Onboard Administrator early in the transition process forces the transition time of the Standby to Active to increase.</p>
