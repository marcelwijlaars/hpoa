        <p class="bodytext">This log displays detailed information for the last Enclosure Firmware Management operation executed on the server and logs the entire session to the iLO VSP. This log is specific for the server, and is cleared anytime a new Enclosure Firmware Management operation is started on the server. This log is also cleared when the server is removed from the enclosure.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">This log persists across OA reboots and power losses. It is retained on the Standby OA, if present.</p>
