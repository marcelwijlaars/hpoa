        <p class="bodytext">This log displays detailed information for the last Enclosure Firmware Management operation executed on the server. This log is specific for the server, and is cleared any time a new Enclosure Firmware Management operation is started on the server. This log is also cleared when the server is removed from the enclosure and when in set factory mode.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">This log persists across OA reboots and power losses. It is retained on the Standby OA, if present.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The firmware log is the most useful resource to determine the progress of an Enclosure Firmware Management operation on a particular server.</p>
