# OpenSSL-Style Names for Remaining Functions in x509.c

The following functions in x509.c still have generic names beginning with `FUN_`. Here are suggested OpenSSL-style names and their rationale:

## 1. FUN_1000c868 - Error handling for split_path operation

```c
/* Original function name: FUN_1000c868 */
void OPENSSL_path_param_check(int path, int dir_buf, int file_buf)
```

**Rationale:**
- Similar to OpenSSL's `OPENSSL_assert` and parameter validation functions
- Checks if path-related parameters are valid
- In OpenSSL 1.0.1, utility functions often use the `OPENSSL_` prefix
- Follows OpenSSL's parameter checking pattern

## 2. FUN_1000c8e8 - String comparison operations

```c
/* Original function name: FUN_1000c8e8 */
unsigned int OPENSSL_str_match_any(char *str, char *s1, char *s2, char *s3, char *s4)
```

**Rationale:**
- Similar to OpenSSL's string utility functions
- Matches a string against a set of possible values
- Uses `OPENSSL_` prefix for utility functions
- Clear name that describes its functionality

## 3. FUN_1000e38c - Close signed hash operations

```c
/* Original function name: FUN_1000e38c */
void X509_cleanup_hash_context(void)
```

**Rationale:**
- Similar to OpenSSL's `EVP_MD_CTX_cleanup` and other cleanup functions
- Cleans up hash data structures
- Uses `X509_` prefix since it's part of certificate operations
- Follows OpenSSL's cleanup function naming pattern

## 4. FUN_1000de80 - Close config operations

```c
/* Original function name: FUN_1000de80 */
void X509_cleanup_validation_context(void)
```

**Rationale:**
- Similar to OpenSSL's context cleanup functions like `SSL_CTX_free`
- Main cleanup function for validation context
- Uses `X509_` prefix as it's related to certificate handling
- Descriptive of its cleanup purpose

## 5. FUN_1000ca0c - Main validation entry point

```c
/* Original function name: FUN_1000ca0c */
unsigned int X509_verify_signed_file(void)
```

**Rationale:**
- Similar to OpenSSL's `X509_verify` function
- Main entry point for file verification
- Uses `X509_` prefix following certificate operation convention
- Clearly describes the verification purpose

## 6. FUN_1000cb68 - Check for fingerprint in firmware

```c
/* Original function name: FUN_1000cb68 */
unsigned char X509_has_fingerprint(void)
```

**Rationale:**
- Similar to OpenSSL's boolean check functions (which often start with "has_" or "is_")
- Returns a boolean indicating if fingerprint is present
- Uses `X509_` prefix for certificate operations
- Clearly indicates its purpose of checking fingerprint existence

## 7. FUN_1000e064 - Set private key ID

```c
/* Original function name: FUN_1000e064 */
void X509_set_key_id(char *param_1)
```

**Rationale:**
- Follows OpenSSL's setter pattern like `X509_set_pubkey`
- Sets the private key ID for certificate operations
- Uses `X509_` prefix for certificate-related functionality
- Clear description of its purpose

## 8. FUN_1000e2b4 - Initialize signed hash

```c
/* Original function name: FUN_1000e2b4 */
void X509_init_signature_hash(int param_1)
```

**Rationale:**
- Similar to OpenSSL's initialization functions like `EVP_MD_CTX_init`
- Initializes a hash for signature verification
- Uses `X509_` prefix for certificate operations
- Clearly indicates its initialization purpose

## 9. FUN_1000e410 - Set hash type

```c
/* Original function name: FUN_1000e410 */
void X509_set_hash_alg(int param_1)
```

**Rationale:**
- Similar to OpenSSL's hash algorithm setting functions
- Sets the hash algorithm type
- Uses `X509_` prefix for consistency with other X509 operations
- `alg` is commonly used in OpenSSL for "algorithm"

## 10. FUN_1000dae4 - Validate stream

```c
/* Original function name: FUN_1000dae4 */
unsigned int X509_verify_file_data(unsigned int param_1)
```

**Rationale:**
- Similar to OpenSSL's verification functions
- Verifies data from a file descriptor
- Uses `X509_` prefix for certificate verification operations
- Clearly indicates verification of file data

## 11. FUN_1000b510 - Get filename function

```c
/* Original function name: FUN_1000b510 */
char *X509_get_signed_filename(void)
```

**Rationale:**
- Follows OpenSSL's getter pattern like `X509_get_subject_name`
- Gets the filename of signed file
- Uses `X509_` prefix for certificate-related operations
- Clear description of its purpose

---

These naming suggestions follow OpenSSL 1.0.1 conventions where:
- X509_ prefix is used for certificate-related operations
- OPENSSL_ prefix is used for general utility functions
- Function names clearly describe their purpose
- Names are consistent with similar functions in OpenSSL 1.0.1
- Verb-object pattern is used (get_filename, set_key_id, etc.)
- Common abbreviations like "alg" for "algorithm" match OpenSSL conventions
